- Checkboxes on tasks or in task descriptions
- Calendar system with deadlines / sprints
- Online / multi-user support

## Known Issues

- Tab move_left/move_right/edit/delete buttons sometimes stay visible even though the mouse has moved off the tab. Mouse over the tab again to fix this.
- In some themes, using underscores in your text will offset text placement downward, which looks bad. I have been unable to find free fonts for Gothic and Hagaki theme that dont have this issue.
- Deleting settings/theme files from userfolder might fix potential startup crashes.

## Disclaimers

Antivirus / Windows Defender might complain when first running the program, since OS functions are called to create/rename/delete files in your %AppData/Roaming/Godot user folder.
